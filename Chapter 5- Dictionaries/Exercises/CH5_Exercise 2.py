# Think of five programming words youâ€™ve learned about in the previous chapters. 
#Use these words as the keys in your glossary, and store their meanings as values.

#Print each word and its meaning as neatly formatted output. You might print the word followed by a colon and then its meaning, or print the word on one line and then print its meaning indented on a second line. 
#Use the newline character (\n) to insert a blank line between each word-meaning pair in your output.
